 <p>I was eleven.
 <br><br>
I used to see all sort of serials, biopics, movies, reality shows, cartoons, fashion TV, everything with my mum. We go crazy together. My summer vacations were not so usual like others, being an introvert, I kept myself in the home for whole day. Morning were occupied with half-watched movies or cartoons, lunch went well with Savdhaan India and Crime Patrol, and dinner is always fixed with Big Boss! It was an easy-pissy, lazy life. As all girls do, I wanted a perfect height, a figure, beauty, wit, and what not. Children are full of stupid dreams and often laugh on it as years roll by.
One day I thought of learning a sport, just to increase my height and to get a little near to perfect. I did well with badminton so we went for that, in a day-boarding school, which was walking distance away from my home. But that facility was stopped some weeks before and the coach convinced us for tennis. I was undoubtedly a bright student, having less of stamina but more of zeal! I was doing well, but after some months most of the kids with me dropped out as the fees was doubled. I used to play with little-ones and the coach gave me special attention ofcourse. I doubted him a lot but never gave much stress on it.
<br><br>
As said, Life takes a round, when you think things are going straight. It was my time to get hit by waves, so called teenage life.
On a usual routine-basis I went for my tennis coaching in the evening all ready. The weather was fantastic and clouds heavy. After sometime clouds poured down water and the court was wet. I didn’t knew the fact that when it gets wet we cannot practice on it anymore and had to stop the class abruptly. We sat in a room, big boys and girls took their bag packs and went off gleefully. Now we were ten in number, they called their parents and also left me all alone one by one. Now I was in the school with 5 male teachers and not having a phone and didn’t even dared to ask Sir to make a phone call. Then Sir came to me asked my parents phone no. Unfortunately my papa’s phone was out of reach, my mamma never carried phone when she went to her mamma’s house, her diurnal work. Then I tried for my elder sister, she is a focused, quick-witted girl, but still ignored a call from an unknown number. I sat with a hope that they’ll call back for me. Every minute went slow like decades. My coaches seemed devil to me. Their every step near me horrified and that terror was giving me chills through my spine. “Empty mind, is the home of devil”, my Savdhaan India and other crime related serials played their roles. I sat with my curled fingers, biting my nail. After an hour, I gathered a little strength told Sir my home address and that I too can walk away. But they said a big NO. I felt their intentions where wrong and my mind kept making stories in that way.
When you are alone you just think of all the evils that can fall upon you.
<br><br>
 “I JUDGED THEM”. I was hurt and broken by my wide-eyes dreams. Breathing seemed harder with every minute, and I could not even cry in front of strangers.
 <br><br>
Whoosh…
<br><br>
<br>
<br>
A hand on my shoulder. My eyelashes went thick and I could not dare to look above. Abruptly breaking the chain of my thoughts, my coach asked me for a little practice now as the rain stopped outside, and began within me.
I did what he said but my mind was out from this place.
<br><br>
Court had voices.
<br>
Wind said words.
<br>
Walls have ears.
<br>
And, beast tell lies.
<br>
Beware the rain.
<br>
Beware the man
<br>
You think You know!
<br><br>
And the time ticks by… It was 6:00 p.m. 
Mamma, and sis with their periodicity came up. I went with them my coaches bid me a goodbye, but my fear prevented me from seeing my own impropriety.
I didn’t said a word about it but learnt a lesson for forever.
<br><br>
DO NOT JUDGE BOYS, DO NOT JUDGE ANYONE BEFORE YOU GET TO KNOW THEM!
<br><br>
It’s not easy. I agree. And, here’s no easy metric in the social arena for what is right and what is wrong. You need to keep a straight mind, a good mental attitude. As a teenager we have mixed thoughts bounded by parents, our society and social media. And they need to be treated.
Having good emotional access and the ability to talk about feelings is really important in adolescence when periods of emotional duress are just part of the normal teenage passage.
<br><br>
As sense of see, hear, smell, touch, intuit, think is a must. Similarly, the capacity to understand feelings is also important and to be real about them and finally to deal with them open-minded.
