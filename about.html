<h2>FRESH ANGLE ON FAMILIAR THINGS</h2>
<p>Creative approach is my signature
<br><br>
Hi my name is Shourya Gupta, 18. I am a tireless seeker of knowledge, occasional purveyor of wisdom and also coincidentally, doing my graduation in Computer Science and engineering from Vellore Institute of Technology.<br>
I have always been a story-teller. It all started with writing silly imaginary pieces when I was younger. I love to observe and to capture emotions in form of a tale.<br>
When not writing, I like drawing and dancing. I consider all of them as a way to reach others and to bring out real you and to understand the complexities of emotions and the skilful nature.</p>
